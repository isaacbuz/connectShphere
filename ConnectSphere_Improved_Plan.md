# Starling.ai: The Decentralized AI-Powered Social Web

## 1. Executive Summary

Starling.ai is a fully decentralized, AI-powered, Web3 social media platform. It integrates blockchain-based ownership, Dogecoin microtransactions, and agentic AI for content moderation, personalization, and governance. Built to scale from MVP to an "everything app," Starling.ai aims to redefine social engagement by turning every user into a stakeholder and every interaction into economic value.

## 2. Problem & Opportunity

Traditional platforms:
- Monetize users without compensating them.
- Centralize control and data.
- Are susceptible to censorship and platform risk.

**Opportunity**: Web3 and AI allow us to build user-owned platforms where data, incentives, and governance are decentralized.

## 3. Vision

A censorship-resistant, intelligent social platform where users:
- Earn from engagement.
- Govern platform policies.
- Experience personalized feeds curated by transparent AI agents.
