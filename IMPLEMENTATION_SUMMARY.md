git clone https://github.com/isaacbuz/connectShphere.git
cd connectShphere
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 3. Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Run tests
npm test
pytest src/tests/test_agents.py -v

# 5. Deploy contracts (testnet)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygonMumbai

# 6. Start agent system
python src/agents/main.py

# 7. Start backend (in new terminal)
npm run dev
```

## üìä Resource Requirements

## üéØ Final Notes

The ConnectSphere platform is now architecturally upgraded with state-of-the-art AI/ML capabilities. The implementation provides:

1. **Autonomous Agents**: Self-organizing agents that handle platform operations
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Ready for millions of users
3. **Decentralized Governance**: True user ownership
4. **Privacy-First**: Federated learning and encryption
5. **Economic Incentives**: DOGE micropayments and SPHERE rewards

The next step is to execute the implementation plan systematically, starting with the GitHub repository setup and issue creation. With the provided foundation, a skilled team can have an MVP ready in 8-10 weeks and a full platform launch in 16 weeks.

Good luck with the implementation! üöÄ
